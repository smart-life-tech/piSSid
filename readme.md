# Raspberry Pi Zero Flask Web Interface Setup

This guide will walk you through setting up a Raspberry Pi Zero with a Flask web interface for configuring Wi-Fi, running scripts, and rebooting the Pi. Additionally, we'll configure the Pi to run your Python scripts at every reboot.

## Prerequisites

- Raspberry Pi Zero (with Raspbian or Raspberry Pi OS installed)
- Basic knowledge of Raspberry Pi and Linux commands
- Access to the terminal on your Raspberry Pi

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Install Flask

Ensure Flask is installed on your Raspberry Pi by running the following command:

```bash
pip install flask
```

### 2. Create a Directory for Your Project

Create a directory for your project and navigate to it using the terminal:

```bash
mkdir my_flask_project
cd my_flask_project
```

### 3. Create the Flask App

Create a Python script (e.g., `app.py`) for your Flask app in the project directory. You can use the sample code provided in the previous responses as a starting point.

### 4. Create HTML Templates

Inside your project directory, create a subdirectory named `templates` to store your HTML templates. Create an `index.html` file inside the `templates` directory, following the example provided earlier.

### 5. Configure Routes

In your `app.py` script, configure the Flask routes for configuring Wi-Fi, running scripts, and rebooting the Pi. Ensure you have routes for `/configure_wifi`, `/run_scripts`, and `/reboot` as shown in the example code.

### 6. Run the Flask App

Run your Flask app by executing the following command inside your project directory:

```bash
python app.py
```

Your Flask app should now be running. You can access it by connecting to the Pi's access point and entering the Pi's IP address in your web browser.

### 7. Make Scripts Executable

Ensure that the Python scripts you want to run at every reboot are executable. You can use the `chmod` command to make them executable:

```bash
chmod +x /path/to/your/script1.py
chmod +x /path/to/your/script2.py
chmod +x /path/to/your/script3.py
```

### 8. Configure Scripts to Run at Boot

To run your Python scripts at every reboot, you can add them to the `rc.local` file. Edit the `rc.local` file using a text editor:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/rc.local
```

Add the following lines before the `exit 0` line, replacing `/path/to/your/script.py` with the actual paths to your scripts:

```bash
python /path/to/your/script1.py &
python /path/to/your/script2.py &
python /path/to/your/script3.py &
```

Save and exit the text editor.

### 9. Reboot the Pi

Reboot your Raspberry Pi to apply the changes:

```bash
sudo reboot
```

Your Flask app should start automatically after the reboot, and your scripts will run as well.

## Usage

- Connect to the Pi's access point when in close proximity.
- Open a web browser and enter the Pi's IP address to access the web interface.
- Configure Wi-Fi, run scripts, and reboot the Pi using the provided web interface.

## Security Considerations

- Be cautious when running scripts at boot; ensure they are secure and error-tolerant.
- Secure your Flask app with authentication and consider using HTTPS for sensitive operations.
- Implement security best practices when deploying the Pi in a public or untrusted network.

```

Please replace `/path/to/your/script1.py`, `/path/to/your/script2.py`, and `/path/to/your/script3.py` with the actual paths to your Python scripts in the "Make Scripts Executable" and "Configure Scripts to Run at Boot" sections.
```

### 1. Set Up a Custom Domain

Edit the `hosts` file on the devices that need to access the Pi's web interface. 

- On macOS and Linux, you can edit `/etc/hosts`.

Add a line like this:

```
192.168.1.100  raspberrypi.local
```

Replace `192.168.1.100` with the actual IP address of your Raspberry Pi.


### 2. Run the Flask App

Run your Flask app by executing the following command inside your project directory:

```bash
python app.py
```

Your Flask app should now be running. You can access it by entering `http://raspberrypi.local` in your web browser.
