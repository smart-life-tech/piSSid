# Raspberry Pi Zero Flask Web Interface Setup

This guide will walk you through setting up a Raspberry Pi Zero with a Flask web interface for configuring Wi-Fi, running scripts, and rebooting the Pi. Additionally, we'll configure the Pi to run your Python scripts at every reboot.

## Prerequisites

- Raspberry Pi Zero (with Raspbian or Raspberry Pi OS installed)
- Basic knowledge of Raspberry Pi and Linux commands
- Access to the terminal on your Raspberry Pi

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Install Flask

Ensure Flask is installed on your Raspberry Pi by running the following command:

```bash
pip install flask
```

### 2. Create a Directory for Your Project

Create a directory for your project and navigate to it using the terminal:

```bash
mkdir my_flask_project
cd my_flask_project
```

### 3. Create the Flask App

Create a Python script (e.g., `ssid.py`) for your Flask app in the project directory. You can use the sample code provided in the previous responses as a starting point.

### 4. Create HTML Templates

Inside your project directory, create a subdirectory named `templates` to store your HTML templates. Create an `index.html` file inside the `templates` directory, following the example provided earlier.

### 5. Configure Routes

In your `ssid.py` script, configure the Flask routes for configuring Wi-Fi, running scripts, and rebooting the Pi. Ensure you have routes for `/configure_wifi`, `/run_scripts`, and `/reboot` as shown in the example code.

### 6. Run the Flask App

Run your Flask app by executing the following command inside your project directory:

```bash
python ssid.py
```

Your Flask app should now be running. You can access it by connecting to the Pi's access point and entering the Pi's IP address in your web browser.

### 7. Make Scripts Executable

Ensure that the Python scripts you want to run at every reboot are executable. You can use the `chmod` command to make them executable:

```bash
chmod +x /path/to/your/script1.py
chmod +x /path/to/your/script2.py
chmod +x /path/to/your/script3.py
chmod +x /path/to/your/ssid.py
```

### 8. Configure Scripts to Run at Boot

To run your Python scripts at every reboot, you can add them to the `rc.local` file. Edit the `rc.local` file using a text editor:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/rc.local
```

Add the following lines before the `exit 0` line, replacing `/path/to/your/script.py` with the actual paths to your scripts:

```bash
python /path/to/your/script1.py &
python /path/to/your/script2.py &
python /path/to/your/script3.py &
python /path/to/your/ssid.py &
```

Save and exit the text editor.

### 9. Reboot the Pi

Reboot your Raspberry Pi to apply the changes:

```bash
sudo reboot
```

Your Flask app should start automatically after the reboot, and your scripts will run as well.

## Usage

- Connect to the Pi's access point when in close proximity.
- Open a web browser and enter the Pi's IP address to access the web interface.
- Configure Wi-Fi, run scripts, and reboot the Pi using the provided web interface.

## Security Considerations

- Be cautious when running scripts at boot; ensure they are secure and error-tolerant.
- Secure your Flask app with authentication and consider using HTTPS for sensitive operations.
- Implement security best practices when deploying the Pi in a public or untrusted network.

```

Please replace `/path/to/your/script1.py`, `/path/to/your/script2.py`, and `/path/to/your/script3.py` with the actual paths to your Python scripts in the "Make Scripts Executable" and "Configure Scripts to Run at Boot" sections.
```

### 1. Set Up a Custom Domain

Edit the `hosts` file on the devices that need to access the Pi's web interface. 

- On macOS and Linux, you can edit `/etc/hosts`.

Add a line like this:

```
192.168.4.1  raspberrypi.local
```

Replace `192.168.4.1` with the actual IP address of your Raspberry Pi.


### 2. Run the Flask App

Run your Flask app by executing the following command inside your project directory:

```bash
python ssid.py
```

Your Flask app should now be running. You can access it by entering `http://raspberrypi.local` in your web browser.

## to set up the webserver to be running the access point mode we need to the following
### If you want your Raspberry Pi to behave as a Wi-Fi hotspot that users can connect to in order to configure Wi-Fi settings, you'll need to set up your Pi as an Access Point (AP) with a captive portal. A captive portal is a web page that users are redirected to when they connect to the Pi's hotspot, allowing them to configure Wi-Fi settings.

# Here are the steps to set up your Raspberry Pi as a Wi-Fi hotspot with a captive portal for configuring Wi-Fi settings:

1. **Install Required Packages**:

   First, make sure you have the necessary packages installed:

   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install hostapd dnsmasq
   ```

2. **Configure Hostapd**:

   Edit the `hostapd` configuration file:

   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/hostapd/hostapd.conf
   ```

   Add the following content to the `hostapd.conf` file, replacing `your_ssid` and `your_password` with your desired SSID and password:

   ```text
   interface=wlan0
   driver=nl80211
   ssid=your_ssid
   hw_mode=g
   channel=7
   wmm_enabled=0
   macaddr_acl=0
   auth_algs=1
   ignore_broadcast_ssid=0
   wpa=2
   wpa_passphrase=your_password
   wpa_key_mgmt=WPA-PSK
   wpa_pairwise=TKIP
   rsn_pairwise=CCMP
   ```

   Save the file and exit.

3. **Configure DHCP and DNS with Dnsmasq**:

   Edit the `dnsmasq` configuration file:

   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/dnsmasq.conf
   ```

   Add or modify the following lines :

   ```text
   interface=wlan0
   dhcp-range=192.168.4.2,192.168.4.20,255.255.255.0,24h
   ```

   Save the file and exit.

4. **Enable IPv4 Forwarding**:

   Edit the sysctl configuration:

   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/sysctl.conf
   ```

   Uncomment the line that says `net.ipv4.ip_forward=1`. Save and exit.

   Activate the changes:

   ```bash
   sudo sysctl -p
   ```

5. **Configure Network Interfaces**:

   Edit the `/etc/network/interfaces` file:

   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/network/interfaces
   ```

   Modify the `wlan0` section as follows:

   ```text
   auto wlan0
   iface wlan0 inet static
       address 192.168.4.1
       netmask 255.255.255.0
   ```

   Save the file and exit.

6. **Create a Captive Portal Web Page we already have this so you can skip**:

   Create an HTML file for your captive portal page, for example, `index.html`. we customize this page to allow users to input Wi-Fi settings and submit the form. Place it in an easily accessible location on your Pi.

7. **Configure Captive Portal Redirection**:

   Create a `dnsmasq` configuration file for captive portal redirection:

   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/dnsmasq.d/redirect.conf
   ```

   Add the following line, replacing `/path/to/your/index.html` with the actual path to your captive portal HTML file:

   ```text
   address=/#/192.168.4.1
   ```
   
   Save the file and exit.

8. **Restart Services**:

   Restart the `dnsmasq` and `hostapd` services:

   ```bash
   sudo service dnsmasq restart
   sudo service hostapd restart
   ```

9. **Start at Boot**:

   To ensure that the hotspot configuration starts at boot, you can add the service restart commands to the `/etc/rc.local` file:

   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/rc.local
   ```

   Add the following lines before `exit 0`:

   ```bash
   service dnsmasq restart
   service hostapd restart
   ```

   Save and exit the file.

10. **Reboot Your Raspberry Pi**:

    After completing these steps, reboot your Raspberry Pi:

    ```bash
    sudo reboot
    ```

`Your Raspberry Pi should now function as a Wi-Fi hotspot with a captive portal, allowing users to connect and configure Wi-Fi settings through the captive portal web page. They can connect to the hotspot SSID and access the portal using a web browser.`

### troubleshooting
It appears that you're facing some issues with package installation and service enabling. Let's address these issues step by step:

1. **Package Installation Error**:

   It seems that there was a problem fetching the `hostapd` package due to a "400 Bad Request" error. This can sometimes happen if the package repository is experiencing issues or if there's a network problem.

   To resolve this, you can try running the following commands to update the package lists and try installing the packages again:

   ```bash
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get install hostapd dnsmasq
   ```

   If you still encounter issues, consider changing the package repository to a different mirror. You can edit the `/etc/apt/sources.list` file to specify a different mirror. Here's an example of how to do it:

   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list
   ```

   Inside the file, replace the existing mirror with a different one. For example, you can use the default Raspbian mirror by changing the line to:

   ```
   deb http://archive.raspbian.org/raspbian bullseye main contrib non-free rpi
   ```

   Save the file and try running the package installation commands again.

2. **Service Enabling Error**:

   The error message "Failed to enable unit: Unit file dnsmasq.service does not exist" and "Failed to enable unit: Unit file hostapd.service does not exist" suggests that the service unit files for `dnsmasq` and `hostapd` are missing.

   This typically happens when the packages are not installed correctly. To resolve this, make sure you've successfully installed `dnsmasq` and `hostapd` as mentioned in the previous step. If you've installed them, they should provide the necessary service unit files.

   After reinstalling the packages, you can try enabling the services again:

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl enable dnsmasq
   sudo systemctl enable hostapd
   ```

   
   ### If your internet connection crashes after restarting the `dnsmasq` and `hostapd` services, it could be due to conflicts between the settings of your Raspberry Pi's Wi-Fi hotspot and your internet connection. Here are some steps to resolve this issue:

1. **Check Configuration Files**:

   Ensure that the configurations for your Wi-Fi hotspot (`hostapd`) and DNS/DHCP server (`dnsmasq`) do not conflict with your internet connection settings. Specifically, check that the IP address range and subnet used for your hotspot do not overlap with your home network's IP range.

2. **IP Address Range Conflict**:

   If both your hotspot and home network are using the same IP address range (e.g., both using the `192.168.1.x` range), conflicts can occur. To avoid this, you should configure your hotspot to use a different IP address range.

   Update your `/etc/dnsmasq.conf` file to specify a different IP range for your hotspot. For example:

   ```conf
   # Change the IP address range for your hotspot
   dhcp-range=192.168.4.2,192.168.4.254,255.255.255.0,24h
   ```

   Ensure that the range you specify here does not overlap with your home network's IP range.

3. **Separate Network Interfaces**:

   Consider using separate network interfaces for your hotspot and your internet connection. For example, you can use one Wi-Fi adapter for the hotspot (wlan0) and another for internet access (wlan1 or eth0).

   Configure your hotspot settings to use wlan0, and ensure that wlan1 (or eth0) is configured to connect to your home network or router for internet access.

4. **Routing and NAT**:

   Ensure that your Raspberry Pi is configured to perform Network Address Translation (NAT) if needed. NAT allows devices connected to your hotspot to access the internet through your Raspberry Pi.

   You can enable NAT by modifying your `/etc/sysctl.conf` file. Uncomment or add the following line:

   ```conf
   net.ipv4.ip_forward=1
   ```

   Then, apply the changes using:

   ```bash
   sudo sysctl -p
   ```

   Additionally but not required, you may need to set up iptables rules for NAT. This ensures that traffic from devices connected to your hotspot is correctly routed to the internet.

   ```bash
   sudo iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o wlan1 -j MASQUERADE
   sudo iptables -A FORWARD -i wlan1 -o wlan0 -m state --state RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT
   sudo iptables -A FORWARD -i wlan0 -o wlan1 -j ACCEPT
   ```

   Be sure to adjust the interface names (`wlan0` and `wlan1`) as needed based on your network configuration.

5. **Reboot**:

   After making these changes, reboot your Raspberry Pi to ensure that the new network configurations take effect:

   ```bash
   sudo reboot
   ```

   Once the Raspberry Pi reboots, test your internet connection to ensure it's working correctly.

By following these steps and ensuring that your hotspot and home network settings do not conflict, you should be able to use your Raspberry Pi as a Wi-Fi hotspot without disrupting your internet connection.

### The warning "no server found in /run/dnsmasq/resolv.conf" indicates that the `dnsmasq` service running on your Raspberry Pi is unable to find DNS servers in the `/run/dnsmasq/resolv.conf` file, which could be causing the DNS resolution issue.

To resolve this issue and ensure that DNS resolution works correctly, you can follow these steps:

1. **Check DNS Server Configuration**:

   Open the `/etc/dnsmasq.conf` file on your Raspberry Pi to check if it is configured to use specific DNS servers. You can use the following command to open the file:

   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/dnsmasq.conf
   ```

   Look for lines that specify DNS server addresses, for example:

   ```conf
   server=8.8.8.8
   server=8.8.4.4
   ```

   Ensure that these lines are present, and the DNS server addresses are valid. You can use Google's DNS servers (`8.8.8.8` and `8.8.4.4`) as shown in the example.

2. **Restart `dnsmasq`**:

   After verifying the DNS server configuration in the `/etc/dnsmasq.conf` file, restart the `dnsmasq` service to apply the changes:

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart dnsmasq
   ```

   This should refresh the DNS settings and resolve the warning message.

3. **Check `/run/dnsmasq/resolv.conf`**:

   The `/run/dnsmasq/resolv.conf` file should be automatically generated by `dnsmasq` based on the DNS servers specified in the configuration file. If this file is empty or contains incorrect information, you can try regenerating it:

   ```bash
   sudo rm /run/dnsmasq/resolv.conf
   sudo systemctl restart dnsmasq
   ```

   This will delete the existing file and restart `dnsmasq` to generate a new one with the correct DNS server information.

4. **Check `/etc/resolv.conf`**:

   Ensure that the `/etc/resolv.conf` file contains a reference to the `dnsmasq` DNS server by including the line:

   ```
   nameserver 127.0.0.1
   ```

   This line tells the system to use the `dnsmasq` service as the DNS resolver.

5. **Check DNS Resolution**:

   After making these changes, try pinging Google again to see if DNS resolution is working:

   ```bash
   ping www.google.com
   ```

   If DNS resolution is working correctly, you should be able to ping Google successfully.

By following these steps and ensuring that `dnsmasq` is correctly configured to use valid DNS servers, you should be able to resolve the DNS resolution issue on your Raspberry Pi.
